Great — with **3–4 hours daily**, you can progress FAST.
I’ll answer both questions:

1️⃣ *Your learning plan (free, structured, optimized for 3–4 hours/day)*
2️⃣ *How to practice on a real Spark cluster for free (yes, there are ways — legally & safely)*

---

# ✅ **1. FREE 6-Week Spark Learning Plan (3–4 hours/day)**

This plan is realistic and gets you from zero → job-ready with hands-on projects, even without paid platforms.

---

## **📌 Week 1 — Foundations + Setup (Python API, Spark SQL, DataFrames)**

**Daily goals (3–4 hours):**

* Watch **Edureka Spark Full Course** (free on YouTube)
* Install **Spark locally** using:

  * PySpark
  * OR Databricks Community Edition (still free)
* Learn basics:

  * Spark architecture
  * Transformations vs Actions
  * Wide vs narrow transformations
  * RDDs vs DataFrames

**Hands-on:**

* Load CSV/JSON data
* Apply transformations (filter, select, groupBy, join)
* Write results to Parquet

---

## **📌 Week 2 — Spark SQL + Structured APIs (Core Skill for Jobs)**

**Daily goals:**

* Spark SQL deep dive (SELECT, JOIN, WINDOW functions)
* DataFrames API (agg, withColumn, explode, nested data)
* Catalog & views
* File formats (Parquet, ORC, Delta basics)

**Hands-on:**

* Build a small analytics pipeline (e.g. “movie ratings analytics”)
* Combine SQL and DataFrame APIs
* Optimize using caching and explain()

---

## **📌 Week 3 — Streaming + Real-time Data Pipelines**

**Daily goals:**

* Learn **Structured Streaming**
* Set up:

  * File-streaming
  * Socket-streaming
* Use Watermarking
* Use aggregations over windows

**Hands-on:**

* Build a mini real-time pipeline

  * simulate a Kafka stream (you can do file-based stream if Kafka is too heavy locally)

---

## **📌 Week 4 — Spark MLlib + Feature Engineering Pipelines**

**Daily goals:**

* Learn Spark ML pipeline API
* Transformers & Estimators
* Feature engineering:

  * Tokenizer
  * VectorAssembler
  * OneHotEncoding
* Text classification or regression

**Hands-on:**

* Build a full ML pipeline (e.g. job salary prediction, sentiment analysis, etc.)
* Export the model

---

## **📌 Week 5 — Production Topics**

**Daily goals:**

* Partitioning & bucketing
* Spark cluster concepts
* Shuffle optimization
* Catalyst optimizer
* Adaptive Query Execution (AQE)
* Caching strategies

**Hands-on:**

* Optimize a slow Spark job
* Measure before/after with explain()

---

## **📌 Week 6 — Final Capstone Project (Portfolio)**

Choose ONE large project (these impress employers):

### ⭐ Project Ideas

✔ Real-time log processing system
✔ News/Reddit analytics pipeline (daily ingestion + cleaning + ML)
✔ Spark SQL data warehouse on top of a large dataset
✔ Clickstream analytics pipeline
✔ Build a feature store using Spark

I can help you design the full project if you choose one.

# ✅ 2. *Is there a free way to practice on a real Spark production cluster?*

YES — here are ALL the **free, legal** options.

---

# 🔥 **Option 1 — Databricks Community Edition (100% Free)**

This is the *closest thing to a real production-level Spark experience*, but free.

### What you get:

* A real **managed Spark cluster**
* Jobs, notebooks, ETL pipelines
* Spark SQL Editor
* ML runtime
* Cluster lifecycle management
* Real cluster logs
* Real distributed compute

### Limitations:

* Small cluster (1 driver + 1 worker)
* Limited runtime types

👉 **Perfect for all training**, and used by many companies.

---

# 🔥 **Option 2 — Google Dataproc Free Tier ($300 credits for 90 days)**

Create a **real Spark + Hadoop cluster** with:

* Multiple worker nodes
* Auto-scaling
* Kafka integration
* Cloud storage (GCS)
* Full production-level environment

You get **$300**, which is A LOT for Spark learning.

If you manage clusters carefully, the credits last weeks.

---

# 🔥 **Option 3 — Local Docker Cluster with Spark Standalone Mode (Free)**

If your machine has 8–16 GB RAM, you can simulate a mini-cluster:

* 1 master
* 2–3 worker nodes
  (using Docker containers)

This is very close to real production behavior:

* shuffle across nodes
* caching
* cluster UI
* worker loss
* scheduling

I can generate the **full docker-compose file** for you.

---

# 🔥 **Option 4 — Kubernetes + Spark Operator (Free if you use Minikube)**

You can practice:

* Spark on Kubernetes
* Submitting jobs
* Monitoring with Spark UI
* Scaling executors

Everything runs on your machine, but behaves like a production cluster.

---

# 🚫 What is *not* free

AWS EMR — no free tier
Azure HDInsight — no free tier
Cloudera — trial only

---

# ⭐ Best FREE way overall

### **Databricks Community Edition**

* a **local Docker Spark cluster**
* final project in GitHub

This gives you enough portfolio material to land Spark/data jobs.

---

If you want, I can now prepare for you:
**→ A complete 6-week calendar with daily tasks**
or
**→ A full production Spark project with architecture + code + tasks**

Which one should I prepare next?
