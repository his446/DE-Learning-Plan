# 🛠️ **Project Ideas to Add to Your Portfolio (Data Engineering + Spark)**

## **1. Real-Time Analytics Pipeline**

**Stack:** PySpark + Kafka + Delta Lake
**Build:**

* Kafka stream produces JSON events
* Spark Structured Streaming consumes & transforms
* Store clean data in Delta lake

**Skills gained:** streaming, checkpoints, window functions.

---

## **2. End-to-End ETL Pipeline (Classic DE Project)**

**Stack:** Spark SQL + Parquet + Airflow (optional)
**Build:**

* Ingest raw CSV from a public dataset
* Clean, normalize & deduplicate records
* Write optimized Parquet + partitioning
* Create analytical aggregates

**Skills gained:** transformations, file formats, optimization.

---

## **3. Spark + MLlib Mini Machine Learning Workflow**

**Build:**

* Use Spark ML to train a classifier (e.g., churn prediction)
* Feature engineering with Spark DataFrames
* Save model using MLlib pipelines

**Skills gained:** distributed ML, feature pipelines.

---

## **4. Data Lakehouse Project**

**Stack:** Databricks Community Edition
**Build:**

* Bronze → Silver → Gold architecture using Spark
* Batch & streaming
* Delta tables

**Skills gained:** modern data engineering.
