# ⭐ **5. Practical Projects You Can Build (All Free)**

Here are some real-world, portfolio-ready Spark projects you can do without paying for anything:

### **📌 1. Real-Time Streaming Pipeline (Medium Difficulty)**

Tools:

* PySpark Structured Streaming
* Kafka (local)
* Databricks Community Edition

Build:

* producer sends streaming data (JSON)
* Spark consumes and transforms it
* writes to Delta or Parquet

---

### **📌 2. End-to-End ETL Pipeline With PySpark (Beginner)**

Use a public dataset:

* NYC Taxi
* Amazon Reviews
* Kaggle dataset (any CSV)

Tasks:

* clean
* transform
* aggregate
* store as Parquet
* optimize using partitioning + caching

---

### **📌 3. Data Lakehouse Mini-Project**

You can use Databricks free cluster:

* Bronze: raw
* Silver: cleaned
* Gold: features or aggregates

---

### **📌 4. Spark MLlib Project (Intermediate)**

Example:

* Predict flight delays
* Build a recommendation system
* Use TF-IDF + pipeline models

---

### **📌 5. Log Parsing With PySpark**

Take Apache web server logs or application logs and parse them:

* extract IPs
* detect patterns
* count usage per endpoint

Very practical for data engineering roles.

---

# ⭐ **6. Learning Roadmap (A Simple 4-Week Plan)**

### **Week 1 — Foundations**

* Learn DataFrames
* Transformations
* Actions
* Joins
* GroupBy
* Read/Write formats (CSV, Parquet)

### **Week 2 — Performance**

* Partitions
* Catalyst optimizer
* Shuffle / narrow vs wide transformations
* Caching

### **Week 3 — Real Workflows**

* ETL pipeline
* Using Spark on Databricks
* Good practices (columnar ops, avoiding UDFs)

### **Week 4 — Build Portfolio Projects**

Pick 2–3 good ones from above.
