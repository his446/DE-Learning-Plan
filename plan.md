Great — with **3–4 hours every day**, you can make **VERY fast progress**.
Here is a **structured 6-week Spark roadmap** that gives you **solid foundations + practical experience + 3 real portfolio projects** — using **100% free resources**, except the books you *optionally* add.

---

# 🚀 6-Week Apache Spark Learning Plan

### *3–4 hours daily • Practical • Project-focused • Uses free resources*

---

# 🗓️ **WEEK 1 — Spark Foundations (Core Concepts + PySpark Basics)**

### **Goal:** Understand Spark architecture + get hands-on with basic APIs.

### **Daily Work (3–4h/day)**

1. **Watch the first part of this free Spark full course (YouTube):**
   Search: *"Apache Spark Full Course Edureka"*
   → Complete: architecture, RDD vs DataFrame, Spark SQL basics.

2. **Install & set up your environment:**

   * Install Apache Spark locally
   * Install Python 3.x
   * Install Jupyter Notebook OR VSCode + Python extension

3. **Hands-on coding (very important):**

   * Create SparkSession
   * Load CSV / JSON files
   * Do simple transformations (select, filter, groupBy)
   * Write results to file

### **End-of-Week Mini Project (Portfolio Item 1)**

**"COVID Data Insights with PySpark"**

* Use any public COVID dataset
* Clean data (missing values, types)
* Run analytics (top affected countries, monthly trends, etc.)
* Export results

Upload to GitHub: notebooks + README + screenshots.

---

# 🗓️ **WEEK 2 — DataFrames, Spark SQL & Data Engineering Essentials**

### **Goal:** Become very comfortable with DataFrames (the most used API).

### **Daily Work**

1. Continue the free Spark course

2. Follow the free Databricks Academy training:
   Search: *"Databricks free training Lakehouse Fundamentals"*

3. Practice:

   * Joins and advanced DataFrame operations
   * Window functions (rank, partition, rolling calculations)
   * Aggregations
   * UDFs (user-defined functions)
   * Reading from different formats: CSV, JSON, Parquet
   * Writing Parquet & partitioning data

### **End-of-Week Mini Project**

**"Sales Analytics Pipeline with PySpark"**
Use any e-commerce dataset.
You will:

* Clean, normalize, transform
* Compute KPIs (best sellers, customer value, monthly revenue)
* Write results in Parquet partitioned by month

---

# 🗓️ **WEEK 3 — Structured Streaming (Real-Time Processing)**

### **Goal:** Learn Spark’s real-time capabilities.

### **Daily Work**

1. Follow free tutorials on Spark Structured Streaming (YouTube).

2. Simulate real-time data using:

   ```bash
   tail -f file.txt
   ```

   or generate messages using Python.

3. Learn:

   * Streaming DataFrames
   * Triggers
   * Watermarking
   * Writing streams to console / files

### **End-of-Week Project**

**"Real-Time Log Monitoring System"**

* Stream logs in real-time
* Detect errors, warnings
* Print real-time metrics

Upload this to GitHub too — simple but highly impressive.

---

# 🗓️ **WEEK 4 — Spark MLlib + Feature Engineering**

### **Goal:** Use Spark for machine learning.

### **Daily Work**

1. Learn Spark MLlib basics
2. Practice:

   * VectorAssembler
   * StringIndexer
   * Pipelines
   * Train/test splits
   * Linear Regression + Classification
   * Model evaluation (RMSE, F1, accuracy)

### **End-of-Week Project**

**"Spark ML Pipeline: Predict Taxi Trip Duration"**
Dataset: NYC Taxi Trips (free)
You will:

* Clean
* Encode features
* Build ML Pipeline
* Train + evaluate model

---

# 🗓️ **WEEK 5 — Optimization & Performance Tuning**

### **Goal:** Learn what distinguishes beginners from real engineers.**

### **Daily Work**

* Understanding Spark’s DAG
* Lazy evaluation
* Caching & persistence strategies
* Shuffle explanation
* Tungsten + Catalyst optimizers
* How to avoid wide transformations
* How to debug with the Web UI

### **Practice:**

* Compare performance with/without caching
* Optimize expensive joins
* Interpret Spark UI stages

### **Optional book (if you want to get advanced):**

**High-Performance Spark** (very worth it for tuning).

---

# 🗓️ **WEEK 6 — End-to-End Final Project (Portfolio)**

### **Goal:** Build a professional, job-ready Spark project.

Choose **one** of these 3 options (I can expand whichever you choose):

---

## ✅ **Final Project Option A: Real-Time Analytics Platform**

**Tech:** PySpark + Streaming
**What it includes:**

* Batch ingestion
* Real-time streaming ingestion
* Aggregation + dashboards
* Partitioned outputs
* Data quality checks
* README with architecture

---

## ✅ **Final Project Option B: Data Engineering Pipeline (Batch + ETL)**

**Tech:** PySpark
**Steps:**

1. Ingest raw data
2. Clean & standardize
3. Build Bronze → Silver → Gold layers
4. Save partitioned Parquet
5. Create analytics & reporting views

---

## ✅ **Final Project Option C: Spark ML End-to-End**

* Data cleaning
* Feature engineering
* ML pipeline
* Optimization
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Final report + charts

---

If you do this plan, by the end of 6 weeks you’ll have:

✔ Strong Spark fundamentals
✔ 3–4 strong GitHub projects
✔ Experience with batch + streaming + ML
✔ Knowledge of optimization
✔ A level good enough for **data engineering & big data pipelines**

---

# 📚 Optional Books (You Don’t Need to Buy, but They’re Great)

If you want to add books later:

1. **Learning Spark, 2nd Edition (Spark 3.x)** → Beginner → Intermediate
2. **Apache Spark in Action (2nd Edition)** → Best for practical projects
3. **High Performance Spark** → Best for optimization & production

---

# 👉 Want me to generate:

* A downloadable PDF of the full roadmap?
* A Trello board version of this plan?
* Or a detailed daily schedule (what exactly to study each day)?

Just tell me.
